    //   "Wettable Powders (WP) are dry, finely ground pesticide formulations that resemble dust but need to be mixed with water before application. They contain 5%â€“95% active ingredients, usually 50% or more, and do not dissolve in water but remain suspended when agitated.",

          "Highly Effective: WP formulations are widely used for pest control and work well with most spray equipment that provides constant agitation.",
          "Excellent Residual Activity: The pesticide remains on surfaces like concrete, plaster, and untreated wood, ensuring long-lasting effects.",
          "Flexible Application: Some products allow for both dust and WP applications, giving applicators more choices.",
